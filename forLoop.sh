Extend the program to take a range of number as input and output the Prime
Numbers in that range.

echo enter m and n
read m n

Write a program that takes a command-line argument n and prints a table of the
powers of 2 that are less than or equal to 2^n.

Write a program that computes a factorial of a number taken as input.
5 Factorial â€“ 5! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5
